# Trivia Trip

On a long road trip, my friends and I usually quiz each other on random trivia facts to help pass time. It's usually hard for us to find
a good website that has a variety of different questions with topics that we enjoy. I created Trivia Trip in hopes to provide my friends and I
with a simple interface that provides us with trivia questions across topics that we enjoy. I also utilized this opportunity to further
develop on my web development skills and touch on some new technologies which I listed below.

Trivia Trip is a single page application that consists of a variety of fun & universal topics such as 
Animals/Science/U.S. States/Math/etc... It utilizes jService.io's trivia API to populate the trivia questions

Trivia Trip comes with some useful features such as :
- a color coded system to define the difficulty of each question
- a display all/hide all answers button
- a responsive mobile capabilities
  
Trivia Trip is built on the following technologies:
- NodeJS
- Express
- Jade HTML Preprocessor
- Bootstrap framework
- HTML/CSS/JS(Jquery)
